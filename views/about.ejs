    <h1>Our cause</h1>
    <p>Here at tight spot we believe that people who are struggling finding a home. Whether you're a young adult with his/her life ahead of you, a family with young children or an elderly couple. Any and all may apply and have a chance to post an ad anonymously
      and explain how you like your situation, budget, and conditions that you have to work with. Home owners,brokers, real-estate agents can all review your ads, and if they feel like they have a place that fits your scenario, they can respond to you.</p>
    <section class="disclaimer">
      <h3>To whom this may apply too</h3>
      <p>We at tight-spot believe all people who are responding to ads should have the responsability to do any sort of background/credit check they feel necessary to negotiate safely</p>
